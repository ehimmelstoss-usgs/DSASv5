# DSASv5
Digital Shoreline Analysis System version 5.0

The software is distributed as an Esri addin file for use within ArcGIS.  After uncompressing the addin (DSASAddin.esriAddIn), you can double-click to launch the Esri ArcGIS Add-In Installation Utility window.  Once installation is complete, the DSAS toolbar can be enabled from within ArcMap (compatible with ArcGIS Desktop Standard 10.4 or 10.5) by going to Customize > Extensions and checking the box next to DSAS.  The toolbar can then be added via Customize > Toolbars.

The software requires Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 or later and utilizes the ArcGIS .NET Support Feature.
